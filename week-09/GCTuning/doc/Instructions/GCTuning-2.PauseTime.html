<h2>
Reduce GC Pause Times</h2>

<blockquote>In this lab you are asked to analyze an application's garbage
collector using the tools GCViewer, VisualGC, and the GC trace output,
if necessary.&nbsp; You have the opportunity to tune the garbage collector
and check the results of your tuning attempts.&nbsp; The goal is to reduce
the duration of the application’s longest GC pause.
<p>The program used for this activity is the same synthetic program that
you used in the previous activity.&nbsp; It periodically allocates chunks
of memory from the heap and releases them again.&nbsp; It runs for two
minutes with a steady allocation rate.&nbsp; On platforms with a slow CPU
it might run longer, especially in its original form before you started
tuning the garbage collector.
<p>Follow the instructions.&nbsp; Use the same table as <a href=GCTuning-1.Throughput.html>before</a>
to keep track of the different tuning approaches and their respective results.
<p><img SRC="Images/table.jpg" NOSAVE height=170 width=499>
<br>A template of this table is available as an Excel file in the skeleton
directory`s subdirectory <tt><font color="#000099">data</font></tt>.
<p>You can retrieve the figures needed for filling in the table from GCViewer
(throughput, pause times) and VisualGC (number of GCs, size of eden, survivor
spaces, old generation, full gc). “E”, “S” and “O” stand for
“Eden”, “Survivors” and “Old Generation”. A look into the trace
output file (usually named gc.log.txt) provides the information whether
a full GC happened or not.&nbsp; Look for the string “<font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>Full
GC</font></font>”, or for “<font face="Lucida Console"><font size=-1>(concurrent
mode failure)</font></font>” if you use the CMS collector.</blockquote>

<ul>
<h3>
Step 1: Execute the Program and Run the Tools</h3>
Compile and run the application as before.&nbsp; Start the GCViewer and
VisualGC tools as before.
<p><b>Important Note:</b>
<br>Running the tools during the test execution might lead to unnaturally
long ‘longest pauses’, especially with weak or single core CPUs. If
you observe any such effect on your test system, consider using two test
runs: one to retrieve information from GCViewer and one without concurrent
execution of the tools to retrieve the values from the trace output via
VisualGC.
<h3>
Step 2: Analyse and Tune</h3>
Let’s start with a recap of one of the tests for ‘maximum throughput’:
With one configuration (64MB, NewRatio=1 and SurvivorRatio=2) we managed
to avoid a full garbage collection for the complete run of the program
and observed that it was the test run with the shortest ‘longest pause’.
This is not surprising, since full collections typically take longer than
minor collections; avoiding full collections results in short ‘longest
pauses’.
<p>The synthetic test program runs for only 2 minutes.&nbsp; What happens
if we consider a server application that runs 7/24?
<p>VisualGC shows us that out test program’s heap usage in the old generation
steadily increases:
<p><img SRC="Images/visualgc.jpg" NOSAVE height=113 width=445>
<p>The diagram shows the entire execution time of 2 minutes; the green
grid represents the old generation.&nbsp; If we had a server application,
that ran 7/24, it would be only a matter of time until a full garbage collection
would occur.&nbsp; Considering the increasing memory consumption, we can
tell that there would be a full collection roughly every 20 minutes or
less.
<p>On the other hand the increase rate is low. We also know that the test
program frees all its memory (at the latest after five minutes). Hence
there is a good chance that using CMS (concurrent mark and sweep garbage
collector) for the old generation would allow a 7/24-application to run
with relatively short ‘longest pauses’.
<h4>
a) Use Concurrent-Mark-and-Sweep (CMS)</h4>
In order to explore the effect of the CMS algorithm, start with a configuration
that has a full collection and check whether CMS eliminates the full collection.
<p>Use the options<tt> –Xms64m –Xmx64m –XX:NewRatio=1</tt> (under
the assumption that it triggered a full collection) and <tt>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC</tt>.
<p>Note, with some systems the JVM ignores the <tt>NewRatio=1</tt>. Check
with VisualGC if <tt>NewRatio=1</tt> works. If not, use <tt>–Xmn32m&nbsp;</tt>
instead of <tt>–XX:NewRatio=1.</tt>
<p>What is the result of this tuning? Can you avoid full collections with
this configuration?
<p>Note that with the CMS collector you cannot use VisualGC any more to
determine if a full collection has occurred. The old generation collection
counter in VisualGC shows the total of all CMS and full collections. You
have to look into the trace output file and must check whether it contains
‘Full GC’.
<p>How do the values for ‘longest pause’ and ‘throughput’ compare
to those that we got in the previous lab without CMS (but with the same
heap size configuration of 64MB and NewRatio=1)?
<h4>
b) Reduce the longest pause time</h4>
Minimum pause tuning for the test program is not as straight forward as
throughput tuning. It depends heavily on the CPU power of your system.
Here are a few guidelines:
<p>Determine if the longest pause stems from a minor collection or a full
garbage collection, which occurred because CMS could not handle the old
generation by itself.
<ul>
<li>
If the longest pause stems from a minor collection, consider decreasing
the young generation size.</li>

<br>The trick is to do this only to the extent that not too many objects
are promoted to the old generation. Otherwise, CMS might fail to handle
the old generation by itself and a full collection is triggered, which
might cause a long pause.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<ul>
<li>
If the longest pause stems from a full collection, you can start CMS earlier,
e.g. when the old generation is filled up by 50%.</li>

<br>For this purpose, use the options <tt>-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=50
-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly</tt>. This might help avoiding a full
collection. You might even consider lower occupancy levels, i.e. 30%.
<br>Another option to consider is the SurvivorRatio, e.g. increase the
survivor spaces and decrease eden. This might help reducing the number
of objects that are promoted to the old generation.</ul>

<h4>
c) Baseline without any tuning options</h4>
Run a test without any tuning options (except CMS usage) as a baseline.
Compare the results from this test to the results from test runs with tuning
options.&nbsp; Compare them also to the results from the default test without
CMS that you have done during throughput tuning. Does the heap configuration
differ?
<h4>
d) Different heap sizes</h4>
How important is memory? Try the tests with 32MB and maybe 48MB, too. Compare
these results to the 64MB tests.
<h4>
e) The big picture</h4>
As before, take a step back and compare all results. Which tunings are
important, and which have only minor effect? What about the default configurations?&nbsp;&nbsp;
How do they compare to your tuning efforts?
<p>How do the tunings for throughput and minimum pause differ? How do the
corresponding results differ?
<p>How was the throughput, when you tuned for minimum pause times and the
minimum pause times when you tuned for throughput?&nbsp; What is a good
compromise?</ul>
