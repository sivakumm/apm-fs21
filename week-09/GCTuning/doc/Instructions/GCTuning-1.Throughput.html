<h3>
What is the point of this activity?</h3>
In this lab you are asked to analyze an application's garbage collector
using the tools GCViewer, VisualGC, and the GC trace output, if necessary.&nbsp;
You have the opportunity to tune the garbage collector and check the results
of your tuning attempts.&nbsp; The goal is to increase the application’s
throughput.
<p>The program used for this activity is a synthetic program that periodically
allocates chunks of memory from the heap and releases them again.&nbsp;
It runs for two minutes with a steady allocation rate.&nbsp; On platforms
with a slow CPU it might run longer, especially in its original form before
you started tuning the garbage collector.
<p>This activity gives you an opportunity to try out some of the GC options
that have been mentioned during the lecture. In principle, you are free
to experiment with as many tuning options as you wish.&nbsp; In practice,
however, it is advisable that you don't experiment thoughtlessly.&nbsp;
For GC tuning it is essential that you stick to a strategy and modify the
JVM settings systematically rather than erratically twisting and tweaking
options here and there.
<p>Follow the instructions.&nbsp; Use the table below to keep track of
the different tuning approaches and their respective results.
<p><img SRC="Images/table.jpg" NOSAVE height=170 width=499>
<br>A template of this table is available as an Excel file in the skeleton
directory`s subdirectory <tt><font color="#000099">data</font></tt>.
<p>You can retrieve the figures needed for filling in the table from GCViewer
(throughput, pause times) and VisualGC (number of GCs, size of eden, survivor
spaces, old generation, full gc). “E”, “S” and “O” stand for
“Eden”, “Survivors” and “Old Generation”. A look into the trace
output file (usually named gc.log.txt) provides the information whether
a full GC happened or not.&nbsp; Look for the string “Full GC”.
<p>What follows is a step-by-step description of the preparations for the
actual analysis and tuning.&nbsp; If you need the JVM GC options you can
find an overview of the options in <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><a href="../Resources/GCViewer-VMflags.html" target="_blank">JVM
options</a>.</font> </font>[<i>Note, this list of&nbsp; JVM options might
be useful as a reference later in your project, since information regarding
JVM-specific options is notoriously hard to find</i>.]
<h3>
Step 1: Compilation</h3>
The work directory for this lab is <tt><font color="#000066">GCTuning</font></tt>.
Its subdirectory <tt><font color="#000066">src</font></tt> contains the
source code for this activity. If you use Eclipse, create a new project
for this activity and import the <tt>test</tt> package. 
<p>Compile the Java source in the <tt><font color="#000066">src</font></tt>
directory.
<h3>
Step 2: Generate GC output</h3>
Run the <tt>Test </tt>program in order to generate GC output. For the purpose
generating GC output you must specify the JVM options <tt>-verbose:GC </tt>and<tt>
-XX:+PrintGCDetails</tt>.&nbsp; In order to capture the GC output in a
file, use the <tt>-Xloggc:&lt;filename></tt> option.
<p>The program invocation could look like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol><tt>>java -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -Xloggc:gc.log.txt test.Test</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</ol>
If you use an IDE, provide the necessary option to the JVM and the program.
In Eclipse, create two run profiles (menu <font face="Arial Narrow">Run
=> Run...</font>), specify the main class <tt>test.Test</tt> and provide
the
<tt>-verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -Xloggc:&lt;filename> </tt>JVM
options (tab <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Arguments</font></font>
=> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>VM arguments</font></font>).
<h3>
Step 3: Start GCViewer</h3>
Find out the GCViewer installation directory and invoke GCViewer. This
can be done like this:
<blockquote><tt>>java -jar &lt;GCViewer_installation_directory>\gcviewer-&lt;version>.jar</tt></blockquote>
In GCViewer, load the GC output file, e.g. <tt><font color="#000066">gc.log.txt</font></tt>.
<h3>
Step 4: Start VisualGC</h3>
First, start the <tt>Test</tt> program.&nbsp; Then, retrieve its vmid,
i.e., open a console window and type in:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><tt>>jps</tt></ul>

<p><br>The <tt>jps</tt> tool is part of the JDK and emits the vmids of
all local JVMs.&nbsp; If it does not emit anything, although the <tt>Test</tt>
program is running, read the trouble shooting section of the VisualGC installation
instructions.
<p>Once you have retrieved the Test program’s vmid, use it for invocation
of the VisualGC tool:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><tt>>visualgc &lt;vmid></tt></ul>

<p><br>The tool’s invocation script is located in its installation directory,
e.g. at <tt>C:\ProgramFiles\jvmstat\bat\visualgc.cmd</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Step 5: Analyse and Tune</h3>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>No options.</b></li>

<br>Start without any tuning options to get a base line. Enter the results
in the above mentioned table. Take a look at the results.
<br>In previous tests on other platforms, the program used around 14 MB
for young and old generation together. How much memory does the program
use on your platform?
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><tt>-Xms32m -Xmx32m</tt></b></li>

<br>Since heap size is important, increase the heap.&nbsp; Use32 MB. How
are the results now regarding throughput, pause time, etc.? How is the
heap divided into young and old generation?
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b><tt>-Xms32m –Xmx32m -XX:NewRatio=&lt;ratio></tt></b></li>

<br>Remember that throughput might benefit from a larger young generation.
<br>Use the –XX:NewRatio=&lt;ratio> option to increase the young generation,
while keeping the total heap size fixed at 32MB.&nbsp; Remember ‘young:old
= 1:ratio’, i.e., smaller values increase the young generation. You might
even want to try a ratio of 1, which splits the heap equally between young
and old generation.&nbsp; Don’t forget to record the results in the table.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
–<b><tt>Xms32m –Xmx32m –XX:NewRatio=&lt;ratio> –XX:SurvivorRatio=&lt;ratio></tt></b></li>

<br>Take a look at the young generation. How large are eden and the survivor
spaces? Use the NewRatio that provided the best results in the previous
test and increase the survivor spaces by using <tt>–XX:SurvivorRatio=&lt;ratio></tt>.&nbsp;
Which SurvivorRatio yields the best results?
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
–<b><tt>Xms64m –Xmx64m –XX:NewRatio=&lt;ratio> –XX:SurvivorRatio=&lt;ratio></tt></b></li>

<br>Since heap size is important, let’s double it. Use <tt>–Xms64m
–Xmx64m</tt> with the ratios for young generation and survivor spaces
that provided the best results with 32 MB. Successively drop the ratios
(first SurvivorRatio, then NewRatio).&nbsp; How do these values compare
to the 32 MB values? How does the tuned 32MB version compare to the non-tuned
64MB version?
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>The big picture.</b></li>

<br>Take a step back and look at the entire table. Which tunings are important
and helpful? Which did only provide minor improvements? If the test program
were your product, which setting would you recommend for your customers?</ul>
</ul>
